This Hotel Management System is a GUI-based application built using Python's Tkinter library, designed to manage hotel guest information. The system allows hotel staff to add, update, search, display, and delete guest records, including details like room number, customer name, check-in/check-out dates, room type, and payment status. The application is connected to a backend database (assumed to be SQLite or similar) via the dbbackend module, which handles database operations such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting guest records. The user interface features a clean, easy-to-use layout with various buttons for performing actions and a listbox to display the records. The system also provides functionality for searching and updating guest details, making it a comprehensive solution for hotel management.
